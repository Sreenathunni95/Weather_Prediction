# Weather Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting weather conditions using machine learning models. The dataset, `weather_prediction_dataset.csv`, contains relevant meteorological data for training and evaluating the models. The Jupyter Notebook, `Weather_prediction.ipynb`, documents the data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model development pipeline.

## Features

- **Dataset:** Includes meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalizes features, and prepares data for modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements various algorithms like regression, decision trees, and neural networks for weather prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assesses model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open `Weather_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
